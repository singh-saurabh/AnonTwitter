# SnowHigh
SnowHigh is a low storage and anonymous social media platform where you can share, comment and like posts from other users.
This application was made in accordance with MDG IIT Roorkee's guitelines https://mdg.sdslabs.co/droidwars/2017/12/04/droid-wars-17/

All the necessary features have been implemented. 
For the additional features, there are

-Recycler Views

-Like and Commenting facilities

-Google Login  

-Material UI (to a large extent)

-Choice for avatars

Note: Since the user is getting authenticated, he is not completely anonymous. I still have access to your email ids (there was a requirement for sign-in in the project description)
Whenever the app is closed and reopened, you get the activity to choose your avatar again. This is to maintain better anonymity.
